# UBL
Universal Business Language

This library is created for the purpose of using Invoice UBL.

Other elements can be added and PR's are welcomed.

If there is a need in the future I will cover more.

Schemas are covered as they are described in the http://www.datypic.com/sc/ubl21/t-ns39_InvoiceType.html
